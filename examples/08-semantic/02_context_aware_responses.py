"""
Semantic Subscriptions: Context-Aware Incident Response

This example demonstrates using SemanticContextProvider to find similar
historical incidents and provide informed responses based on past resolutions.

🎯 Key Concepts:
- SemanticContextProvider for historical context
- Learning from past similar cases
- Context-enriched decision making

🎛️  CONFIGURATION: Set USE_DASHBOARD to switch between CLI and Dashboard modes
