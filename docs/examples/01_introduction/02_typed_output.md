# Advanced Flock Agent with Caching, Type Hints, and Tool Integration

In this example, we'll show you how to build a more advanced Flock system that:

- Uses a custom output formatter (RichTables) for a polished, swaggy display.
- Defines output types using standard Python type hints (including lists and Literals) for structured results.
- Integrates external tools (like a web content scraper) so that agents can perform more complex operations.
- Leverages caching so that if an agent is called with the same input, the cached result is returnedâ€”this is particularly useful for expensive operations such as web scraping or during debugging.

The agent takes a URL as input and outputs:

- A title,
- A list of headings,
- A list of dictionaries mapping entities to metadata, and
- A type (limited to one of 'news', 'blog', 'opinion piece', or 'tweet').

After executing the agent, you can work with the result as a real Python object that respects the defined types.

Let's dive in!

## Code Example

### 1. Imports and Formatter Setup

```python
import asyncio
from pprint import pprint

from flock.core.flock import Flock
from flock.core.flock_agent import FlockAgent
from flock.core.logging.formatters.base_formatter import FormatterOptions
from flock.core.logging.formatters.rich_formatters import RichTables
from flock.core.logging.formatters.themed_formatter import ThemedAgentResultFormatter
from flock.core.tools import basic_tools
```

### 2. Creating and Running the Agent

```python
async def main():
    # --------------------------------
    # Create the flock
    # --------------------------------
    # Some people need some swag in their output
    # See the formatting examples
    format_options = FormatterOptions(RichTables)
    flock = Flock(local_debug=True, output_formatter=format_options)

    # --------------------------------
    # Create an agent
    # --------------------------------
    # Some additions to example 01:
    # - You can define the output types of the agent with standard python type hints.
    # - You can define the tools the agent can use.
    # - You can define if the agent should use the cache.
    #   Results will get cached and if true and if the input is the same as before,
    #   the agent will return the cached result.
    #   This is useful for expensive operations like web scraping and for debugging.
    agent = FlockAgent(
        name="my_agent",
        input="url",
        output="title, headings: list[str], entities_and_metadata: list[dict[str, str]], type:Literal['news', 'blog', 'opinion piece', 'tweet']",
        tools=[basic_tools.get_web_content_as_markdown],
        use_cache=True,
    )
    flock.add_agent(agent)

    # --------------------------------
    # Run the agent
    # --------------------------------
    # ATTENTION: Big table incoming.
    # It's worth it though!
    result = await flock.run_async(
        start_agent=agent,
        input={"url": "https://lite.cnn.com/travel/alexander-the-great-macedon-persian-empire-darius/index.html"},
    )

    # --------------------------------
    # The result type
    # --------------------------------
    # The result is a real Python object with the types you defined.
    # For example, this works:
    pprint(result.title)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Summary

This example demonstrates an advanced Flock system with a custom output formatter, type hints for structured results, external tool integration, and caching functionality. The code is organized into clear sections for setup, agent creation, and execution. Use this as a template for building robust Flock agents.
